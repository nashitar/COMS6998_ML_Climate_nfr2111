In the era of rapid technological advancements and evolving social landscapes, the influence of digital platforms on public opinion and societal discourse has become increasingly significant. This paper delves into the influence of Twitter on public opinion regarding climate change, its impact on government policies, and the role of grassroots movements in shaping discourse. It examines the challenges and advantages of Twitter as a platform for climate change discussions and provides an in-depth explanation of the Word2Vec model used for tweet analysis. Emphasizing the substantial influence of social media on public opinion and policy decisions related to climate change, the study also discusses the implications of these findings for mental health, societal polarization, and policy-making. Additionally, it highlights the prevalence of negative sentiments in tweets discussing climate change from 2007 to 2019, potentially influenced by global events, changing demographics, platform algorithms, and increased awareness of social and political issues on social media. The paper also references previous studies on climate change and environmental governance, including research on scepticism in a changing climate and the involvement of youth climate activists in environmental governance.
